In this project, we have developed an IPL ticket booking system using Java Servlet and JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity).
The system provides a list of upcoming IPL matches and their prices in INR. To book tickets, the user has to enter a few details and opt for their match of choice along with the number of tickets they wish to purchase. The user can also cancel their booking by providing their booking phone number.
The system displays the details of the customer and the final bill amount to be paid. It also stores the information provided into the BoxOffice database.
The frontend is created using HTML and the backend database is stored in MySQL. It is all integrated using Servlet and JDBC.
